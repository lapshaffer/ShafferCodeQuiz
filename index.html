<!-- TO-DO:
1. Make header with link to highscores page on left-hand side and timer on right-hand side
2. Make main page with quiz description and button to start quiz
    The start button, and the question buttons, should all share a class or id so they can be styled alike
3. Store data attributes for each question? And unique ids for each question set
    When a box from each question set is clicked, it switches to the next question stored in the data attributes
4. Know which answers are right and wrong
    And have a place for the screen to say if they're right or wrong
5. When quiz is finished, display score with option to input initials and submit
6. When score is submitted, go to highscores page
    Possibly a separate HTML file that can link back to this one, but one that accesses the same local storage to display the scores-->
